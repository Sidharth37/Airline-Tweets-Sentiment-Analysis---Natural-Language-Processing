# Airline-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis---Natural-Language-Processing
Analysis and classification of airline tweets into positive, negative and neutral. 

The project is divided into 3 main parts:
1) Initial Data Load and Exploratory Data Analysis
2) Data Pre-processing and Vectorization
3) Machine learning modeling and Model Evaluation
<br>

<b>Initial Data Load and Exploratory Data Analysis-</b><br>
The data is loaded using a csv file. The data set contained 219600 tweets and other supplementary information like tweet id, sentiment of the tweet, the confidence associated with the sentiment, tweet location, the date of the tweet, the timezone from which the tweet was tweeted and so on.
<br>
The tweets are associated to 6 major airlines namely - Virgin America, United, Southwest, Delta, US Airways and the American.
A huge majority of these tweets have come from the United States. All of these tweets are from the month of February, 2015.
<br>
Looking at the retweet counts of each of these tweets, these tweets belonged to individuals with a common popularity status, not famous or influential individuals.
<br>

The main reason to focus on the audience, was to understand the lingo on tweets, we are building our Machine Learning Model on.
